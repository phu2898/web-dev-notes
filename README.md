# Web Development Notes

This repository is my personal collection of notes and practice code while learning **Web Development**.

## 📖 About

- **Notes**: I rewrote lessons in my own words to better understand and remember the concepts.
- **Code**: Exercises and practice snippets I typed myself while following along.
- **Projects**: Small projects and exercises to apply what I've learned.
